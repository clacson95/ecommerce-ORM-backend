## Usage

To use this back-end application, fork the repository, clone the repository, or download the ZIP file to access the code for yourself. This will require you to have a text editor. I recommend Visual Studio Code, but there are a plethora of other options available.

Next, follow the Installation instructions below.

Then follow these steps:
1. create schema
    * enter `mysql -u root -p` in the terminal
    * enter your password when prompted
    * enter `source db/schema.sql` in the terminal
    * enter `exit` in the terminal to exit mysql
2. enter `npm run seed` in the terminal to seed the database
3. enter `npm run start` in the terminal to start the application's server

You can then use something like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/products/insomnia) to run tests or make changes to the database.

## Installation
1. Ensure node.js is installed. 
3. Create a `package.json` file by entering the `npm init -y` command in the terminal. 
4. Install dependencies with the terminal command `npm install` or `npm i`
